# 🏠 Smart Home Automation System – Python Project

This is my second Python project developed as part of my learning journey. It simulates a **Smart Home Automation System** using core Python concepts like **Lists**, **Tuples**, **Dictionaries**, **Sets**, and **Functions**.

## 📌 Features

### 1. Device Management (Lists & Tuples)
- Add, remove, and sort smart devices.
- Store device settings such as status and power usage.

### 2. Energy Consumption Tracker (Dictionaries & Sets)
- Track and update energy usage of devices.
- Calculate total energy consumption.
- Manage unique power-saving modes.

### 3. Smart Functions
- Calculate monthly electricity cost.
- Identify common smart devices in two homes.

### 4. Automation Features
- Set automation rules (ON/OFF actions with time).
- Optimize power consumption by turning off high-usage devices.

### 🔁 Bonus: Smart Home AI Assistant
- A function using `*args` and `**kwargs` to simulate a voice assistant that manages device statuses and actions.
